# IceRenderer
Ice Renderer using Height-Map Images In Blender

The heightmap is specified in the blender python script, and when run, a mesh grid is created and modified using the heightmap information, removing any excess information along the way.

The scripts starts with grid then proceeds to displace different points, in the end removing any noise and unecesary displacements afterwards.

Originally built to render ice models, but can also be used to generate terains and other structures using their respective heightmaps.
